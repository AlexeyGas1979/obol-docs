# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## What is Obol?

Obol Labs is a remote first research and software development team focused on POS infrastructure for public blockchain networks. Specific topics of focus are Internet Bonds, Distributed Validator Technology and Multi-Operator Validation. The core team currently includes 10 members that are spread across the world.

The core team is currently building the Obol Network, a protocol to foster trust minimized staking through multi-operator validation. This will enable low-trust access to Ethereum staking yield, which can be used as a core building block in a variety of Web3 products.

## The Network

The network can be best visualized as a work layer that sits directly on top of base layer consensus. This work layer is designed to provide the base layer with more resiliency and decentralization as it scales. In this chapter of Ethereum we will move onto the next great scaling challenge, which is stake centralization. To effectively mititgate these risks, credible neutrality must be used as a primary design principal. 

Obol as a layer is focused on scaling main chain staking by providing permissionless access to Distributed Validators. The network utilizes a middleware implementation of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), to enable the operation of distributed validator clusters that can preserve validators current client and remote signing configurations.

Similar to how roll up technology laid the foundation for L2 scaling implementations, we believe DVT will do the same for scaling main chain staking while preserving decentralization. Staking infrastructure is entering its protocol phase of evolution, which must include trust-minimized staking networks that can be plugged into at scale. Layers like Obol are critical to the long term viability and resiliency of public networks, especially networks like Ethereum. We believe DVT will evolve into a widely used primitive and will ensure the security, resiliency, and decentralization of  the public blockchain networks that adopt it.

The Obol Network develops and maintains four core public goods:

- The [Distributed Validator Launchpad](./dvk/01_distributed-validator-keys.md), a CLI tool and User Interface for bootstrapping Distributed Validators
- [Charon](./dv/01_introducing-charon.md), a middleware client that enables validators to run in a fault-tolerant, distributed manner
- [Obol Managers](./sc/01_introducing-obol-managers.md), a set of solidity smart contracts for the formation of Distributed Validators
- [Obol Testnets](./testnet.md), a set of on-going public incentivised testnets that enable any sized operator to test their deployment before serving for the mainnet Obol Network

### Sustainable Public Goods

The Obol Ecosystem is inspired by previous work on Ethereum public goods and experimenting with circular economics. We believe that to unlock innovation in staking use cases, a credibly neutral layer must exist for innovation to flow and evolve vertically. Without this layer highly available uptime will continue to be a moat and stake will accumulate amongst a few products.

The Obol Network will become an open, community governed, self-sustaining project over the coming months and years. Together we will incentivize, build, and maintain distributed validator technology that makes public networks a more secure and resilient foundation to build on top of.
