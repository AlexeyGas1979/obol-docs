description: Welcome to the Multi-Operator Validator Network

# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## What is Obol?

Obol Labs is a research and software development team focused on distributed validators, multi-operator validation, applied cryptography, and crypto economics. The core team is currently building the Obol Network, a protocol to foster trust minimized staking through multi-operator validation. This will enable low-trust access to Ethereum staking yield, which can be used as a core building block in a variety of Web3 products.

## The Network

The network can be best visualized as a work layer that sits directly on top of base layer consensus. It can be accessed by anyone, but it specifically caters to those staking crypto assets. This work layer is designed to provide the base layer with more resiliency and decentralization as it scales. These layers are critical to the long term viability of public networks, especially networks like Ethereum.

Obol as a layer is focused on securing main chain staking by providing permissionless access to Distributed Validators. The network utilizes a middleware implementation of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), to enable the operation of distributed validator clusters.

Research has determined the most beneficial architecture for DVT networks is similar to the architecture of L2 scaling solutions such as [@optimismPBC](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC) and [@arbitrum](https://twitter.com/arbitrum). DVT is best used as a core primitive in the Web3 stack, which can be most impactful when built on top of.

Staking infrastructure is entering its protocol phase of evolution, which must include trust-minimized staking networks that can be plugged into at scale. We believe DVT will evolve into a widely used primitive and will ensure the security, resiliency, and decentralization of public networks.

### Sustainable Public Goods

Obol is inspired by previous work on Ethereum public goods and experimenting with circular economics.

We believe that to unlock innovation in staking use cases, a credibly neutral layer must exist for innovation to flow and evolve vertically. Without this layer highly available uptime will continue to be a moat.

The Obol Network will become an open, community governed, self-sustaining project over the coming months and years. Its participants will be responsible for the security and decentralization on the world's most used public blockchain networks.

Together we will incentivize, build, and maintain distributed validator technology that makes public networks a more secure and resilient foundation to build on top of.

The Obol Network develops and maintains four core public goods:

- The [Distributed Validator Launchpad](./dvk/01_distributed-validator-keys.md), a CLI tool and User Interface for bootstrapping Distributed Validators
- [Charon](./dv/01_introducing-charon.md), a middleware client that enables validators to run in a fault-tolerant, distributed manner
- [Obol Managers](./sc/01_introducing-obol-managers.md), a set of solidity smart contracts for the formation of Distributed Validators
- [Obol Testnets](./testnet.md), a set of on-going public incentivised testnets that enable any sized operator to test their deployment before serving for the mainnet Obol Network
